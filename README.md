\# CampusGo 🚀



\*\*CampusGo\*\* is a smart indoor navigation system for college campuses.  

It uses \*\*QR codes at entry points\*\* and \*\*AR navigation arrows\*\* on mobile devices to guide students and visitors to their desired destinations.



---



\## 🎯 Project Goal

To make campus navigation simple, accessible, and efficient by:

\- Scanning QR codes at key locations.

\- Choosing the destination from a list.

\- Providing \*\*step-by-step AR navigation arrows\*\* using Unity AR Foundation + ARCore.

\## ✅ Current Progress

\- ✅ Repo initialized with structure  

\- ⬜ Locations \& navigation graph JSON  

\- ⬜ QR codes generated  

\- ⬜ Pathfinding logic in C#  

\- ⬜ Unity AR setup (AR Foundation + ARCore)  

\- ⬜ UI flow integration

\## 📌 Next Steps

1\. Integrate QR scanning into Unity.  

2\. Load graph JSON dynamically.  

3\. Display AR arrows along computed path.  

4\. Test navigation across pilot corridor.
